> Link is the bridge between the YAFAI-Core and clients, enabling communication.
> At its core, this ia gRPC service with reflection enabled, allowing clients to discover available services and methods dynamically.

## Proto file schema

```proto
syntax = "proto3";

option go_package = ".;link";

package link;


service ChatService{
    rpc ChatStream (stream ChatRequest) returns (stream ChatResponse);
}

message ChatRequest{
    string request = 1;
}

message ChatResponse{
    string response = 1;
    string trace = 2;
    
}
```

## Usage
To use the Link service, you can generate client code using the `protoc` compiler with the appropriate plugins for your programming language. For example, in Python, you can use:

```bash
python -m grpc_tools.protoc -I. --python_out=. --grpc_python_out=. link.proto
```
This will generate the necessary client and server code to interact with the Link service.

## Example Client
```python
import grpc
from link_pb2 import ChatRequest, ChatResponse
from link_pb2_grpc import ChatServiceStub
def main():
    channel = grpc.insecure_channel('localhost:50051')
    stub = ChatServiceStub(channel)

    # Create a request
    request = ChatRequest(request="Hello, YAFAI-Core!")

    # Send the request and receive the response
    response_stream = stub.ChatStream(iter([request]))

    for response in response_stream:
        print(f"Response: {response.response}, Trace: {response.trace}")
    channel.close()
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
``` 
This example demonstrates how to connect to the Link service, send a chat request, and receive responses in a streaming manner. You can adapt this code to fit your specific use case and programming language.
